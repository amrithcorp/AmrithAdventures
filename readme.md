# Amrith Adventures
### Introduction
Here, I've organized a repo of old scripts from an assorted bunch of projects. Some of these projects were exercises in a certain tool, and some of them were open source projects that I was paid to be apart of. Some of these projects are also completely bamboozling, in that I have no idea what I was trying to accomplish, nor what problem I was trying to solve when I wrote them. Enjoy!

### Contents
- AWS-Lambda: A single script that was designed to test and utilize the ability of AWS lambda to run synchronous and high-pressure blockchain functions in real time. The result? AWS Lambda excels at delivering competitive price-performance for automated cron-like jobs. 
- Monero: A little web wallet, built on top of the existing Monero Python SDK, to manage balances in a custodial fashion. 
- Stellar-Horizon: A series of experiments and exercises in calling the various methods and reading data from Stellar's Horizon server. I found this series especially eye opening, as it later allowed me to build production-level Decentralized Applications, which treated the blockchain as it's entire back-end. 

P.S: All of this code is old. Don't expect it to run without some tinkering! :)
